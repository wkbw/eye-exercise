## Description
The goal of this project is modify the existing files, first by adding a second eye then second, using *onmousemove* to simulate synchronistic movement of the eyes so they follow wherever the mouse moves across the browser window.

## How to Run
* To run, open ___index.html___.
* Drag your the mouse across and up and down the screen and watch as the eyes follow the mouse's path whereever it goes.


## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Some ideas to make his googly-eyes exercise *pop*:

* Have the eyes begin movement with an initial mouse click event then stop moving when there is a second mouse click event.
* Add iris color to the eyes.
* Add eylashes and make the eyes blink by using *setInterval()* method and mouse click events.

## Learning Insights

It was interesting to experiement with (mouse) events and see how just a few lines of code can add interactivity.
